                <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
                "As North Carolina’s urban research university, UNC Charlotte is a diverse and inclusive institution with local-to-global impact that transforms lives, communities and industries through access and affordability, exemplary undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs, scholarship, creative work, innovation and service." -UNCC
                <br>
                <h3>UNCC's History</h3>
                "In the 1940s, cities across the United States experienced an acute need for workforce expertise to meet marketplace demands sparked by World War II technologies. UNC Charlotte – first known as Charlotte College – is among the universities founded in metropolitan areas for that purpose. Initially offering only evening classes at Charlotte Central High School, the institution has grown in size and mission to become the region’s preeminent research university, addressing critical 21st-century business, technology, health care, energy and education needs. Discovery, learning and collaboration take place at two Charlotte locations: a vibrant 1,000-acre campus in University City and an uptown site designed specifically to serve the businesses, organizations and people of an urban center." -UNCC
